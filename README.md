# NovelTokenToken - AI-Assisted Novel Editor (Local Storage Version)

NovelTokenToken is a lightweight, single-page web application designed to help authors outline and structure their novels. It focuses on managing chapters and scene beats, and facilitates interaction with external AI/LLM services (like ChatGPT, Claude, etc.) through specialized prompt generation and copy/paste workflows.

**Key Concept:** All your novel data (chapters, scene beats, summaries, generated text) is stored **exclusively in your browser's Local Storage**. There is **no server backend** and **no direct integration** with any AI services. You manually copy prompts generated by the app and paste them into your preferred AI tool, then paste the results back into the app.

        *   Summaries of previous chapters (if available).
        *   Text of previous scene beats in the current chapter.

## How to Use

1.  **Download:** Obtain the `novel_editor.html` file from this repository. You can either:
    *   Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your-username/noveltokentoken.git`
    *   Download the `novel_editor.html` file directly.
2.  **Open:** Open the `novel_editor.html` file in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari). Double-clicking the file should usually work.
3.  **Start Editing:**
    *   You'll see the list of novels (initially empty).
    *   Create a new novel using the input field and button.
    *   Click "Open" to edit a novel.
    *   Add chapters and scene beats.
    *   Use the "Copy Prompt" buttons to interact with your chosen AI tool.
    *   Paste the AI-generated summaries or continuations into the designated text areas.
    *   Your work is saved automatically as you make changes.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML5:** Structure of the application.
*   **CSS3:** Basic styling (embedded within the HTML file).
*   **JavaScript (ES6+):** Application logic, DOM manipulation, local storage interaction.
*   **Browser Local Storage API:** For data persistence.

## Data Storage

*   **All data** (novels, chapters, scene beats, summaries, generated text) is stored in your browser's **Local Storage**.
*   This means the data is specific to the **browser and device** you are using. It won't sync automatically to other devices or browsers.
*   **Be careful:** Clearing your browser's cache or site data for the origin where you opened the file **will permanently delete your novels**. Consider backing up important work manually (e.g., copy/pasting text elsewhere).
*   Local storage has size limits (usually around 5-10MB), which should be sufficient for text-based outlines but could be a constraint for extremely large projects.

## Limitations & Scope

This is a deliberately simple, local-first tool. It **does not** include:

*   Direct integration with any AI/LLM APIs.
*   Cloud storage, backup, or synchronization features.
*   Multi-user or collaborative editing capabilities.
*   Rich text formatting or advanced text editing features.
*   User authentication or accounts.
*   Offline capabilities beyond the initial page load (requires browser access).
